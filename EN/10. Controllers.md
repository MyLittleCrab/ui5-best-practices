It is highly recommended to inherit your page controller not from the standard **sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller**, but from your own custom **BaseController**.

**That is, with the following inheritance hierarchy:**
1. sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller — implements the framework's internal methods
2. BaseController — contains methods reused by all controllers in the application
3. MyPageController — the controller for a specific page

This way, you keep your code clean and leave only the **business logic of the page** in the child controller, moving everything else to the parent. This makes it much easier to read, check, and debug.

Utility methods needed in almost all UI5 applications are placed in a common **BaseController** class, which you can simply connect to your application.
