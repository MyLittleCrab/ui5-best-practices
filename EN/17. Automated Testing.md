Automated testing is a crucial part of the modern SAPUI5/Fiori application development process. It allows you to:
- Quickly catch errors early,
- Simplify refactoring,
- Guarantee stability when updating dependencies and the platform,
- Save time on manual testing.

## Types of tests

### 1. Unit tests
Test individual functions, classes, utilities.  
**Recommended tools:**  
- [QUnit](https://sap.github.io/openui5-docs/topics/91f0e03b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html) — the standard for UI5, integrated out of the box.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) — for TypeScript/ES6 utilities if separated.

**Best practice:**
- Move business logic out of controllers into separate services/utilities — they are easier to test.
- Don’t test the UI5 framework, test your own logic.

### 2. Integration tests
Test interaction between modules, working with models, services, routing.

**Best practice:**
- Use QUnit for integration scenarios (e.g., data loading, error handling).
- Mock external services (OData, REST) via sinon.js or QUnit’s built-in features.

### 3. UI/End-to-End tests
Test the application “through the eyes of the user”: clicks, data entry, navigation between screens.

**Recommended tools:**  
- [OPA5](https://sap.github.io/openui5-docs/topics/6a6a2cfaab244c7f9a6c57b2b7c1f9c8.html) — the standard for UI5, allows writing scenarios in a “human” language.
- [wdi5](https://github.com/js-soft/wdi5) — a modern tool for e2e tests of UI5 apps based on WebdriverIO (supports CI/CD, Jenkins/GitHub Actions integration).

**Best practice:**
- Cover main user scenarios (login, create/edit/delete entity, navigation) with smoke tests.
- Don’t try to cover everything with UI tests — they are expensive to maintain, focus on critical business processes.

## How to organize tests in a project

- Put all tests (unit, integration, opa) in the `/webapp/test` or `/test` folder.
- For QUnit/OPA5 use the standard structure:
  ```
  /webapp
    /test
      /unit
      /integration
      /opa
  ```
- For wdi5 — a separate `/e2e` folder in the root.

---

## CI/CD integration

- Run tests automatically on every commit/merge (e.g., via GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).
- For QUnit/OPA5 use headless browsers (Chrome Headless, Puppeteer).
- For wdi5 — set up to run in a Docker container or on a dedicated runner.

## Tips and best practices

- **Write testable code:** move business logic out of controllers, avoid hard dependencies.
- **Mock all externals:** don’t rely on real services/backends in unit/integration tests.
- **Test not only the happy path:** test errors, empty responses, edge cases.
- **Document scenarios:** describe what each test checks.
- **Don’t forget linters and static analysis** — this is also part of quality automation (see "Linters").

## When tests are necessary and when not (with examples)

### When tests are mandatory

1. **Critical business logic**
   - Example: calculating the final order amount with discounts, taxes, currencies.
   - Why: an error can lead to financial loss or legal issues.
   - How to test: unit tests for calculation functions, integration tests for data model interaction.

2. **Complex user scenarios**
   - Example: multi-step wizard for document creation, with checks and branches at each step.
   - Why: easy to break during changes, hard to manually check all variants.
   - How to test: e2e tests (OPA5/wdi5), unit tests for individual steps.

3. **Migrations, refactoring, dependency updates**
   - Example: migrating from UI5 1.71 to 1.120, mass renaming of models or services.
   - Why: high risk of breaking something in different parts of the app.
   - How to test: run the full set of unit and e2e tests after changes.

4. **Reusable components used everywhere**
   - Example: a common date picker used on 20+ screens.
   - Why: a bug in the component affects the whole app.
   - How to test: unit tests for the component, integration tests for typical scenarios.

5. **Integration with external services**
   - Example: payment gateway integration, sending data to SAP backend.
   - Why: errors can lead to data loss or incorrect business processes.
   - How to test: mock external services, unit and integration tests.

### When tests are not mandatory (but still useful)

1. **Temporary prototypes, MVPs**
   - Example: quick prototype for a customer demo, not for production.
   - Why: code will be thrown away, no point in spending time on tests.

2. **Minor visual tweaks**
   - Example: changed button color, adjusted spacing, changed screen text.
   - Why: such changes are easy to check visually, automation won’t pay off.

3. **One-off scripts/utilities**
   - Example: data migration script run once manually.
   - Why: easier to check manually than write tests for code that won’t be reused.

4. **Very simple components**
   - Example: component that just displays static text or an icon.
   - Why: minimal chance of error, tests add little value.

### Edge cases

- If a component/function may become critical in the future — better to add tests right away.
- If the team changes often and the project is long-lived — tests save time on onboarding and maintenance.
- If you have CI/CD — even minimal test coverage helps catch regressions automatically.

> **Summary:**
> Tests are a risk management tool. The higher the cost of an error, the more automation you need. But don’t aim for 100% coverage at any cost — a reasonable balance between effort and benefit is always more important.
