For deployment to on-premise systems, the de-facto standard is [ux-ui5-tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling).

A convenient console tool **fiori** can build applications, run them in a dev environment for testing, and deploy to the SAP system.

It is included by default in almost all relatively modern project templates. If you want to implement it in an old project based on other tools (e.g., from webIDE or old tooling), you can use the **migration tool** from the [SAP Fiori Tools - Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.sap-ux-fiori-tools-extension-pack). It will automatically generate the necessary configs based on your requests, which you can then conveniently and flexibly adjust.

The main deployment configuration when using [ux-ui5-tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling) will be in the project root in the **ui5-deploy.yaml** file:

```yaml
specVersion: "3.1"
metadata:
  name: name
type: application
builder:
  resources:
    excludes:
      - /test/**
      - /localService/**
  customTasks:
    - name: deploy-to-abap
      afterTask: generateCachebusterInfo
      configuration:
        target:
          url: https://url.to.your.system
          client: "200"
        app:
          name: appname
          package: packagename
          transport: transportRequest
        exclude:
          - /test/
```

The main thing here is to be attentive and enter the actual transport request number during development.
