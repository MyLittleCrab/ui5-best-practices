For web frontends, error handling is one of the most important topics, especially due to the large number of objects. Anything can go wrong at any time.

## Ideally, you need to handle two types of errors:
1. Something failed on the frontend (e.g., a `throw new Error('message')` somewhere)
2. Something failed on the backend (BUSI_EXCEPTION/any other system error/dump during request processing)

To avoid duplicating error handling code every time, it is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to move it to a utility class and call it as needed.

So, instead of a bulky construction like this:
```JavaScript
this.getView().setBusy(true);
this.getModel().read("/Entity('key'", {
    ///.......
    error: function () {
        sap.m.MessageBox.error("Error!", {
            styleClass: this.getOwnerComponent().getContentDensityClass()  
        });
        this.getView().setBusy(false);
    },
    success: function(oData){
        // Processing, which can also potentially throw errors
        // And here you’ll also have to do
        // try { } catch (e) { }
        // callback hell expected here
    }
});
```
can be replaced with a more minimalistic and clear approach:
```JavaScript
this.getView().setBusy(false);
try{
    const entity = await this.useOdata().read("/Entity('key')");
    // Processing, which can also potentially throw errors
    // throw new Error("An error occurred while processing X");
} catch(e) {
    this.showMessage(e); // A method in the parent class for parsing oData errors

} finally {
    this.getView().setBusy(false);
}
```
In general, you can just leave a single line for error handling.
If you need to handle something for business logic, you can catch the specific error right here.

For unification, I suggest a class with an error parser and a **BaseController** class with explicit methods for displaying errors to the user.

## Use the right control

1. **Informational and success messages** — can be shown via [Message Toast](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.71.75/#/entity/sap.m.MessageToast)
2. **Error and warning messages** should be shown explicitly to the user — in a popup dialog ([MessageBox](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.71.75/#/entity/sap.m.MessageBox) or [Dialog](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.71.75/#/entity/sap.m.Dialog)). For displaying multiple errors, use [MessageView](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.71.75/#/entity/sap.m.MessageView).

(If you use **BaseController** from my repository, you already have this in the showMessage() method)
