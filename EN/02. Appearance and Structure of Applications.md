## Design:
UI5 has a [built-in UI kit that is well integrated into the framework](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/).
It comes with detailed documentation and examples.
Moreover, most companies have pre-configured themes for this kit.

**So, if you can express your business logic using existing UI components — don’t reinvent the wheel.**

But if you really want to create something custom: it’s best to take inspiration from existing elements in terms of appearance and UX. [UI5 design guidelines are here.](https://www.sap.com/design-system/fiori-design-web/v1-136/discover/sap-design-system/sap-fiori?external)

## Page Structure:

SAP strongly recommends organizing all business logic on a page using so-called [**floorplans**](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/797c3239b2a9491fa137e4998fd76aa7).

### The main ones are:

1. [List Report](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/c0eec49db81a441e878f528c8f3d28de)
   Most often used together with **Object Page (see below)**. A page with filters at the top and a data table in the center (usually smartfilterbar + smarttable). When you click on a specific item or create a new one, it navigates to the Object Page. **Used for searching and navigating a list of objects.**
2. [Object Page](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/c0eec49db81a441e878f528c8f3d28de)
   A page with fields for a specific entity. At the top — a header with key fields, in the center — the rest. **Used for editing and creating documents.**
3. [Analytical List Page](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/3d33684b08ca4490b26a844b6ce19b83)
   A dashboard with charts/graphical filters.
4. [Overview Page](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/c64ef8c6c65d4effbfd512e9c9aa5044)
   An aggregator of reports in the form of many tiles on one page.
5. [Worklist](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/d1d588f1061b4bac96a1facb80d3f3a2)
   Almost the same as List Report. A page with tables. Filter bar is optional, with a strong focus on processing entities in the table.
