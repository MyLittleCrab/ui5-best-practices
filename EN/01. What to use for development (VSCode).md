After the official SAP plugin package for VSCode was released for UI5 application development, the choice between [BAS](https://www.sap.com/central-asia-caucasus/products/technology-platform/business-application-studio.html)/[WebIDE](https://help.sap.com/docs/web-ide?locale=en-US)/[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) became obvious.

Technically, VSCode with plugins is now almost as functional as the paid cloud-based [Business Application Studio](https://www.sap.com/central-asia-caucasus/products/technology-platform/business-application-studio.html).

## How to set it up conveniently?

1. Install a clean VSCode from the official website
2. Install the latest LTS release of Node.js
3. Install [SAP Fiori Tools - Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.sap-ux-fiori-tools-extension-pack)
4. Install [SAPUI5 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iljapostnovs.ui5plugin) â€” this will add a lot of convenient validation and autocompletion from standard SAP libraries
