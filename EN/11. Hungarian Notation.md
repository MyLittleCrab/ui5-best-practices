Since JavaScript is a **dynamic** language where you cannot explicitly specify variable types, it has become a standard in the UI5 community to use Hungarian notation for readability.

The idea is to explicitly show the variable type by the first letters of its name.

| Variable Name | Data Type         |
|--------------|------------------|
| **s**Id      | string           |
| **o**DomRef  | object           |
| **$**DomRef  | jQuery object    |
| **i**Count   | int              |
| **m**Parameters| map / assoc. array |
| **a**Entries | array            |
| **d**Today   | date             |
| **f**Decimal | float            |
| **b**Enabled | boolean          |
| **r**Pattern | RegExp           |
| **fn**Function| function        |
| **v**Variant | variant types    |

In TypeScript projects, this notation is pointless, since types are checked at compile time. But in regular JavaScript projects, it is strongly recommended to continue using Hungarian notation.

**Additionally:** For describing methods and their arguments, I recommend using JSDOC (AI tools have become quite good at generating JSDOC. It would be a crime to neglect it!)
